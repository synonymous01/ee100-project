# Arrhythmia Detection using ECG data
_I did this by myself_

## How to run this yourself
```
git clone https://github.com/synonymous01/ee100-project.git
```

Open the .mlx file in MATLAB and see the results for yourself!

## Details

In this project, we were given some ECG data on which we had to:
- Preprocess the data
- identify features (summits and troughs) and plot them
- implement automatic arrythmia detection and display a message for when it happens

### The rest of the details should be self-explanatory in the mlx file itself
